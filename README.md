# Common VIM Usage
This repository is a list of the most commonly used VIM motions and commands that I have found useful in my day to day coding. It serves more as a memory jogger for when my hands fail to remember the pattern.

# Quick Reference
- `ct'` - cut to the `'`
- `yt'` - yank to the `'`
- `%y+` - yank to he clipboard instead of the vim register
